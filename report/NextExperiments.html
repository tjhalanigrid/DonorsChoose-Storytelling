<h1>Next Experiments: What We Would Explore Next</h1>

<div class="section">
<h2>Next Experiments</h2>

<ul class="next-experiments-list">
    <li>
        <b>Analyze proposal text quality and clarity.</b><br>
        Future work could examine how writing style, structure, and sentiment in the
        <i>cleaned_essays</i>, <i>cleaned_titles</i>, and <i>cleaned_summary</i> fields influence approval outcomes.
        This would help distinguish strong proposals from weaker ones beyond cost and scale alone.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Study time-to-approval across project types.</b><br>
        If submission and approval timestamps become available in the future,
        measuring how long different projects take to get approved could reveal additional bottlenecks,
        especially for high-cost projects and underfunded subject categories.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Incorporate school- and location-level context using available data.</b><br>
        Using the existing <i>school_state</i> field, future analysis could explore whether approval patterns
        differ systematically across states and whether some regions consistently experience lower success rates.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Build early-warning models for at-risk projects.</b><br>
        Predictive models using project cost, quantity, subject categories, grade level,
        teacher experience, and text features from the proposal could help flag projects with a low
        probability of approval and provide real-time feedback to teachers before submission.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Evaluate the impact of targeted support and visibility strategies.</b><br>
        If targeted support or visibility campaigns are introduced for specific subjects or regions,
        future analysis could assess whether these interventions successfully reduce approval disparities
        across subject categories and experience levels.
    </li>
</ul>
