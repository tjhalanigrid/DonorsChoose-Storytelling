<h1>Funding the Gap: What Drives Project Approval on DonorsChoose?</h1>

<div class="section">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
DonorsChoose allows teachers across the United States to request funding for classroom projects ranging from basic supplies to advanced learning resources.
Although most projects are eventually approved, this high success rate can hide important inequalities.
</p>

<p>
A noticeable group of projects repeatedly fails to receive funding.
For these classrooms, rejection often means unmet student needs and unequal access to learning resources.
</p>

<p>
This project, <b>Funding the Gap</b>, examines where such barriers arise by asking a focused question:
<b>Which types of projects face structural disadvantages, and why?</b>
</p>

<p>
Using historical DonorsChoose data, the analysis studies how approval varies with project cost, scale, teacher experience, grade level, and subject category.
The goal is to reveal consistent patterns that influence funding outcomes and highlight opportunities for a more equitable platform.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Business Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Which project features most strongly influence approval?</li>
    <li>How do project cost and requested quantity affect success?</li>
    <li>Does teacher experience improve approval chances?</li>
    <li>Are some subject categories consistently advantaged or disadvantaged?</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Overall Approval Landscape</h2>

<img src="visuals/overall_approval_rate.png" width="100%">

<p class="caption">
Around <b>85% of projects</b> on DonorsChoose are approved, suggesting that the platform is broadly accessible.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>Why this can be misleading:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Nearly <b>1 in 7 projects</b> still fails to receive funding.</li>
    <li>This represents <b>thousands of unfunded classrooms</b>.</li>
    <li>A high average can hide disadvantages affecting specific project types.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="caption">
This chart provides a baseline.
The key question is not whether projects are approved overall, but <b>which projects struggle most and why</b>.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Does Project Cost Influence Approval?</h2>

<img src="visuals/price_and_project_approval_analysis.png" width="100%">

<p class="caption">
Project cost is one of the strongest constraints on approval.
Although high-cost projects can still succeed, approval rates decline steadily as cost increases.
Lower-cost projects consistently perform better.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>How to read this plot:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>left panel</b> compares cost distributions for approved and rejected projects.</li>
    <li>The <b>right panel</b> shows approval rates across increasing price ranges.</li>
    <li>Approval remains above <b>90%</b> for the lowest-cost projects, but drops to around <b>75–80%</b> for the most expensive ones.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="caption">
This pattern suggests that donors and reviewers prefer projects with clearer cost–impact trade-offs.
Cost alone does not decide approval, but it strongly limits what is likely to succeed.
As budgets increase, projects face greater funding resistance.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>The Role of Teacher Experience</h2>

    width="100%"
    height="600"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>

<p class="caption">
Teacher experience is positively associated with approval.
Teachers with prior successful submissions are more likely to get projects funded,
reflecting stronger platform familiarity and better proposal framing.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>How to read this plot:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The x-axis shows increasing teacher experience.</li>
    <li>Approval rates rise steadily from new to moderately experienced teachers.</li>
    <li>First-time teachers have the lowest success rates, while experienced teachers perform above average.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="caption">
Experience improves success, but it cannot fully offset the disadvantage of high-cost projects.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Cost and Experience: An Interaction Effect</h2>

<img
    src="visuals/approval_rate_experience_level_vs_price_heatmap.png"
    width="100%">

<p class="caption">
Considering cost and experience together reveals a clear interaction.
Although experienced teachers generally perform better, high-cost projects have lower approval
across all experience levels.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>How to read this heatmap:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The x-axis represents teacher experience.</li>
    <li>The y-axis represents project cost ranges.</li>
    <li>Brighter cells indicate higher approval rates.</li>
    <li>Low-cost projects show high approval for all teachers.</li>
    <li>High-cost projects show low approval even for very experienced teachers.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="caption">
Teacher experience improves outcomes, but high project cost remains the dominant constraint.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Project Scale: Quantity and Price Combined</h2>

<iframe

    width="100%"
    height="600"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>

<p class="caption">
This plot combines quantity, total cost and approval outcomes.
Bubble size shows how many projects fall into each group, while color represents approval rate.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>How to read this plot:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The x-axis shows requested quantity and the y-axis shows project cost.</li>
    <li>Each bubble represents a group of similar projects.</li>
    <li>Green bubbles indicate higher approval; red bubbles indicate lower approval.</li>
    <li>Low-cost, low-quantity projects are both common and highly successful.</li>
    <li>High-cost, high-quantity projects have the lowest approval rates.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="caption">
Approval likelihood drops sharply as projects become larger in both quantity and cost.
The combined scale of a project matters more than either factor alone.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Differences Across Subject Categories</h2>

<img
    src="visuals/approval_rate_subject_categories.png"
    width="100%">

<p class="caption">
Approval rates differ substantially across subject categories.
Some subjects consistently perform above the platform average, while others lag behind.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>How to read this plot:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Each bar represents a subject category and its approval rate.</li>
    <li>Higher bars indicate stronger donor and reviewer support.</li>
    <li>Lower bars indicate subjects that struggle more often.</li>
    <li>Core academic and classroom-essential subjects generally perform better than specialized or enrichment subjects.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="caption">
These gaps suggest that donor preferences and perceived urgency influence funding outcomes,
leading some educational needs to be systematically underfunded.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Approval Patterns Across Grade Levels</h2>

<iframe
    src="visuals/grade_vs_approval_and_trend.html"
    width="100%"
    height="600"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
</div>
<p class="caption">
Approval rates vary across grade categories, indicating that projects for different student age groups do not face equal chances of success.
Projects targeting younger students are approved more frequently than those aimed at older grades.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>How to read this plot:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Each bar shows the approval rate for a grade category.</li>
    <li>Projects for early and elementary grades appear at the top of the chart.</li>
    <li>Approval rates decline for middle and high school projects.</li>
    <li>Comparable projects are more likely to be approved for younger grades than for high school.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="caption">
This pattern points to a donor preference for early education, where impact may be perceived as more foundational.
At the same time, it raises concerns about systematic disadvantages for older students.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>How Cost Impacts Approval Across Grade Levels</h2>

<iframe
    src="visuals/project_cost_and_approval_by_grade.html"
    width="100%"
    height="600"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe> 

<p class="caption">
Approval rates decrease as project cost increases across all grade levels, but the decline is strongest for older students.
High-cost projects for middle and high school face the largest approval penalties.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>How to read this plot:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The x-axis shows increasing project cost ranges, and each line represents a grade category.</li>
    <li>Low-cost projects perform well across all grades.</li>
    <li>Approval drops for every grade as cost rises, with the steepest decline for middle and high school.</li>
    <li>High-cost elementary projects perform better than similarly priced high school projects.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="caption">
Older-grade projects are therefore doubly constrained: they are typically more expensive and face stricter approval thresholds.
Cost amplifies existing disadvantages for projects serving older students.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Teacher Experience and Approval Across Grade Levels</h2>

<img
    src="visuals/teacher_experience_grade_approval_analysis.png"
    width="100%">

<p class="caption">
Teacher experience improves approval chances across all grade levels, but its impact is uneven.
Experience helps most for elementary and middle school projects, and less for high school projects.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>How to read this plot:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The x-axis shows increasing teacher experience.</li>
    <li>Approval generally rises as teachers become more experienced.</li>
    <li>Gains are strongest for elementary and middle school projects.</li>
    <li>High school projects remain comparatively disadvantaged even with higher experience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="caption">
Overall, experience acts as a partial equalizer. It improves outcomes for all teachers, but structural factors—especially cost and donor preferences—continue to limit approval for projects serving older students.
</p>
</div>

<h2>What Drives Approval (and What Doesn’t)</h2>

<iframe
    src="visuals/correlation_heatmap.html"
    width="100%"
    height="600"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>

<p class="caption">
No single numeric feature strongly determines approval. Most measurable variables show only weak linear relationships with project outcomes.
</p>

<div class="viz-explanation">
<b>How to read this heatmap:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Each cell shows the correlation between a numeric feature and project approval.</li>
    <li>Values near zero indicate little linear relationship.</li>
    <li>Teacher experience has a small positive association with approval.</li>
    <li>Cost and quantity show weak negative associations.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="caption">
These results confirm that approval cannot be explained by any single factor. Instead, outcomes depend on how multiple factors interact, together with qualitative elements not captured in numeric data.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Key Insights</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Approval is driven by interacting factors.</b> No single variable explains success.</li>
    <li><b>Project cost is the strongest constraint.</b> Approval declines steadily as budgets increase.</li>
    <li><b>Teacher experience helps, but with limits.</b> It cannot fully offset high cost or large scale.</li>
    <li><b>Large and expensive projects are most disadvantaged.</b> Scale matters most when quantity and cost combine.</li>
    <li><b>Systematic gaps persist across grades and subjects.</b> Some groups consistently receive lower approval.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Strengthen onboarding for new teachers.</b> Provide templates, examples, and budgeting guidance.</li>
    <li><b>Support realistic project scoping.</b> Use budget feedback tools to align requests with funding patterns.</li>
    <li><b>Create dedicated pathways for high-cost, high-impact projects.</b></li>
    <li><b>Increase visibility for underfunded grades and subjects.</b></li>
    <li><b>Monitor interactions, not single metrics.</b> Track cost, experience, grade, and scale jointly.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>
When certain classrooms or project types repeatedly fail to receive funding, the result is lost learning opportunities rather than isolated rejections.
</p>

<p>
This analysis shows that approval gaps are driven largely by structural factors—project cost, scale, grade level, and donor preferences—rather than individual teacher effort alone.
Teachers serving older students and proposing larger or less visible projects face persistent disadvantages.
</p>

<p>
Targeted platform support, improved guidance, and equity-focused funding initiatives can help ensure that resources reach classrooms based on need and potential impact.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Next Experiments</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Analyze proposal text quality and clarity.</b></li>
    <li><b>Study time-to-approval across project types.</b></li>
    <li><b>Incorporate school- and district-level context.</b></li>
    <li><b>Build early-warning models for at-risk projects.</b></li>
    <li><b>Evaluate the impact of targeted interventions.</b></li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>
This study analyzes more than one hundred thousand DonorsChoose projects to understand what drives approval outcomes.
Despite a high overall success rate, approval varies systematically across cost, scale, subject, grade level, and teacher experience.
</p>

<p>
<b>Project cost and scale emerge as the strongest constraints</b>, while teacher experience improves outcomes but cannot fully overcome structural disadvantages.
Several subjects and grade levels consistently receive lower approval, indicating the influence of donor preferences and platform dynamics.
</p>

<p>
Overall, funding gaps are driven more by systemic factors than by individual teacher effort, highlighting the need for targeted support and equity-oriented platform design.
