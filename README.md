# Funding the Gap – DonorsChoose Data Storytelling Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes DonorsChoose classroom funding data using visual storytelling techniques.  
The goal is to understand which projects get approved and why, focusing on subject categories, grade levels, project cost, and teacher experience.

The project is designed for non-technical stakeholders and emphasizes clarity, interpretability, and real-world impact.
