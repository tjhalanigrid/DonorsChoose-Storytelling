# Funding the Gap – DonorsChoose Data Storytelling Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes DonorsChoose classroom funding data using visual storytelling techniques.  
The goal is to understand which projects get approved and why, focusing on subject categories, grade levels, project cost, and teacher experience.

The project is designed for non-technical stakeholders and emphasizes clarity, interpretability, and real-world impact.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify factors influencing project approval  
- Highlight disparities across subjects and grade levels  
- Understand the role of teacher experience  
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving equity

## 📊 Key Insights
- Subject category strongly influences approval rates  
- Projects for younger students are slightly more likely to be approved
